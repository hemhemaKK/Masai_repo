# Debounced User Search from Firebase 🔍

This project demonstrates a simple web app that performs **debounced user search** using data stored in **Firebase Realtime Database**. It fetches user data (name and email), filters the list in real-time as the user types, and only makes a search request after the user stops typing for 1 second (debouncing). It also features a "Go to Top" button and keystroke/search counters.
